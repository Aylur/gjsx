# Gjsx

Convenience libraries for GNOME JavaScript (GJS).

If you are not already familiar with GJS and GObject,
you should read [gjs.guide](https://gjs.guide/) first.

This library provides:

- GObject [decorators](https://aylur.github.io/gjsx/gobject) for subclassing
- state and binding utilities
- [JSX](https://aylur.github.io/gjsx/jsx) for both Gtk and Gnome extensions

## Example apps using Gjsx

- [icon-theme-browser](https://github.com/Aylur/icon-theme-browser)

## Planned Features

- upgrade to use stage 3 decorators
- dbus decorators with async method support
